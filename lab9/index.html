					<h2>Challenge</h2>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p id = "problems-p">For step 8,
						<ul>
							<li>I wasn't sure what method to use.</li>
							<li>I tried to use setAttribute with font-style and font-size but that didn't work.</li>
							<li>I then consulted with my partner, who told me to try new1El.id instead of setAttribute for changing the attribute.</li>
							<li>I then tried removing the quotes from the ID names in index.html</li>
							<li>After fixing the outputEl definition (it was missing the document. prefix), I successfully got innerHTML to write to the index.html</li>
							<li>Text wasn't showing because I initialized new2El as an img element and assigned it an h3 tag.<ul>Once I changed it to an h3 element, the text was able to display.</ul></li>
						</ul>

			<div class ="minor-section" id="reflection">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p id = "reflections-p">I found steps 1-7 rather simple, except with the confusion on what changing the attribute exactly meant. To be honest, I'm still not sure I know what that meant but I hope I was correct. Once I figured out the syntax for changing the element's attributes, I went on a w3Schools spree to make my text look spiffy. I wanted to add an image anyway, so when I read Task X, I saw that as the perfect opportunity to do so.</p>
