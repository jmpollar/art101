			<h1>Lab 8 - Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>the challenge is to take an array of numbers, write a named function to do math on portions of that array, create a new array with values passed to that function, create a third array with values passed to an anonymous callback function, and print these arrays to the console.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had trouble doing addition with a single parameter, because my brain wasn't expecting it to be so simple.</p>
					<p>I decided on squaring the values of the array, and my zeal to put all the values of the array through the function was satiated not with a for-loop as I had intially tried to do, but with the map function. </p>
					<p>I tried and failed to get the array.map to write a complex value to the array; I tried first to pass two arguments to the map function which failed, but then I just used a compound return value for the function it accesses which worked.</p>
