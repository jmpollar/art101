			<h1>Lab 8 - Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge is to take an array of numbers, write a named function to do math on portions of that array, create a new array with values passed to that function, create a third array with values passed to an anonymous callback function, and print these arrays to the console.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had trouble doing addition with a single parameter, because my brain wasn't expecting it to be so simple.</p>
					<p>I decided on squaring the values of the array, and my zeal to put all the values of the array through the function was satiated not with a for-loop as I had intially tried to do, but with the map function. </p>
					<p>I tried and failed to get the array.map to write a complex value to the array; I tried first to pass two arguments to the map function which failed, but then I just used a compound return value for the function it accesses which worked.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Because of the syntactical differences of JavaScript vs C#, C++, and Java, I had a little bit of trouble getting the "grammar" right when writing the code. However, after reading the errors I figured it out. </p>
					<p>I attempted Task X because I felt like it would be a good chalenge and make the page more practical for basic users. I did the first task of outputting the results on the index.html page. I began by assigning the three arrays as a single string and giving that to the outputEl.innerHTML, but it didn't print. It was only when I added text to go along with them that they printed however they were all crunched together. I tried newline, but that didn't work, so I used "br" instead, which did. To make it more readable I added spaces to each array index and formatted the titles of the arrays.</p>
				</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>Here are my results. As you can see, I have my original array, the one that squares its values, and the one that checks to see if its values are divisible by three.</p>
