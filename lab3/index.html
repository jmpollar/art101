			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The goal of this lab is to achieve a practical survey of local file structures, facilitated in part
					through creating, linking, and editing HTML files.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>My problems consisted of not knowing the specific keywords to achieve certain things. For instance,
					linking a website, rotating text, understanding image width, and utilizing effective padding.</p>
				<p>I solved website linking and text rotation by looking up the specific functions for those, then
					experimenting from there. For the padding and image width, I already knew the keywords to access, so
					experimentation was my only method of finding out what met my goals.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I wanted my homepage to be humorous, but also friendly and inviting. I put a picture of me with a big
					ol' grin on it do demonstrate that no, I don't hate the universe, I just look like that 99.99% of
					the time.</p>
				<p>This assignment was refreshing. It was technical, yet open-ended. I really felt like I could let my
					creativity loose and have fun with this webpage.</p>
				<p>I enjoyed writing my bio as well as experimenting with different HTML tags and CSS properties. I
					think it's wonderful being able to see my changes with immediate feedback at the refresh of a page.
				</p>
				<p>Unfortunately I haven't been able to get in contact with the person who agreed to be my partner for
					this lab, so for now, I'm going solo.</p>

				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>I am happy with my results. One of the things that fascinates me about HTML and CSS is how effective
					you can be by manipulating simple parameters such as padding or text color. The customizability is
					insane, and so I ran with that, and had a lot of fun with it. Hopefully you can see that from this
					page, and feel free to check out my homepage below:</p>
