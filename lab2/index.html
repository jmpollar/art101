    <h1>Hello World</h1>

    <p>My partner's name is Anthony. Anthony likes making music and is a 1st year CS major.</p>
    <p>I am James. I also like making music and enjoy making pointless programs. We both think this class is challenging
        but useful for the future.</p>

    <h2>We look forward to an exciting quarter and hope we can make some great webpages in the process!</h2>
