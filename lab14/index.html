				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>Debug old labs to fix any issues and errors.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>I had trouble finding out what the errors mean so I got help from Discord and looked up the errors. Once I knew what the issue was I fixed them accordingly.</p>
