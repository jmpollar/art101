					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge was to use jQuery to create buttons, label them, and toggle a class using a click event listener.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section" id="problems">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had trouble figuring out the syntax of adding attributes to elements in jQuery. SOLUTION: use element.attr(). I had trouble getting the .special class to show its results/know that it is being toggled. SOLUTION: use console.log to make sure my parent access was working; I got a little too ambitious, so I just hard coded the section it's attached to. This still didn't work. SOLUTION 2: I had to remove the "." from the ".special" in the toggleClass call and refer to .minor-section.special in CSS.</p>
