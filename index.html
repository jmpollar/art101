					<h2>James Pollard (AKA: Jimmy, Peter, Dr. Eggman)</h2>
					<p>I like making music and playin' vidya games.</p>
					<p>I like, if you will, to make music <i>for</i> vidya games. Maybe even making music <i><b>IN</b></i> vidya games. Dip your Popeyes biscuit in that.</p>
					<p>If you can't already tell I'm a bit of a goofball. A hooligan. A <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPR1QWb1cYI"><i><b><u>knucklehead mcspazatron</u></b></i></a>, if you must.</p>
					<p>Alright, alright, let's get down to brass tacks.</p>
					<p>I'm a 4th year AGPM major. I'm an intermediate-intermediate programmer, but I do enjoy it. <i>Especially the goofy ones. The ones that serve absolutely no purpose other than to say "Look ma, <b>I DID A THING.</b>"</i></p>
					<p>I also like to go outside. I like swimming, though it's been ages. I rode a bike a couple times. That was cool. Driving is fun, too, just, not always on 17<sub>1</sub>.</p>
					<p>Personally, the coastal weather is a bit too cold for me. I rarely leave the house without a jacket most of the year. <sub>I'm just a wee desert lizard who thinks anything below 70 degrees is cold.</sub></p>
					<p>I'm looking forward to making a groovy website with lots of text, lots of graphics, and dare I say, lots of...</r></p>

					<footer><sub>1</sub>At its best, Highway 17 is a scenic road with twists and turns abound. At its worst it's a rally course-turned-destruction-derby.</footer>
