			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem-solving </h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>
					The challenge is to:
				<ul>
					Write pseudocode for an everyday task.
				</ul>
				<ul>
					Write pseudocode for a simple computer game.
				</ul>
				<ul>
					Introduce ourselves to Javascript comments by inserting pseudocode into this lab's lab.js file.
				</ul>
				<ul>
					Include our pseudocode as lists in our lab 4 index.html file.
				</ul>

				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>
					We had a bit of trouble using ChatGPT to give us pseudocode for banana bread.
				<ul>
					We remedied this by indicating "pseudocode without code".
				</ul>
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>
				<ol>
					<li>I met my partner in section on Thursday, 4-20.</li>
					<li>We decided we would do Rock, Paper, Scissors for the section activity.</li>
					<li>We then decided to keep this game for our pseudocode.</li>
					<li>I wrote out pseudocode for it, and checked it against the pseudocode written by ChatGPT.</li>
					<li>We also wrote pseudocode for the everyday task, but that mostly consisted of choosing a food
						and plugging that into ChatGPT for a recipe.</li>
					<li>We then adapted that recipe into steps and substeps.</li>
				</ol>
				</p>
				<p>
					I attempted to make effective use of nested lists for this assignment to separate tasks and
					subtasks, as well as color-code them. Even in the recipe, I felt things weren't separated enough so
					I made it a goal to make every verb its own step. For the game, I attempted to use coding keywords but still keep things at English level. 
					I made sure to include input validation and an if() sequence as well.
