//Request input from player (1: rock, 2: paper, 3: scissors)
  //if(input>3 || input < 1) {error; re-request input}
  //assign to int variable playerChoice
//have computer produce RNG between 1 and 3
  //assign this to int variable computerChoice
//if statements for outcomes:
  //if(computer = rock and player = scissors)
    //computer wins!
  //if(computer = paper and player = scissors)
