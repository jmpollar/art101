			<h1>Lab 7 - Functions</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The challenge was to create a function in JavaScript that takes a string as input, sorts it, and
					returns the sorted string on the HTML page using document.writeln().</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>The input prompt showed up twice. To solve this I removed the link to the JavaScript file in the head
					section.</p>
				<p>Another issue was getting the sorted username to write to the page. My solution was to remove DEFER
					from the JS load in the HTML file, however this didn't wait for the page to load which seems clunky.
				</p>
				<p>After uploading to my GitHub page, however, the rest of the page loaded before getting the input, so
					the problem was solved.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I didn't find this lab difficult with my experience, so I decided I would challenge myself with Task
					X. I chose to do the task of calling for input outside of the function and passing that to it
					instead of calling for input internally.</p>
				<p>I achieved this by asking for input first and assigning it to a variable. I then passed the variable
					to the updated function (this one needed to take a parameter, the other one didn't), where the same
					sorting technique happened, and the sorted string was returned where it was later printed on the
					index.html page.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>Here is the result of my sorting function. I noted that longer strings carried off the page so I
					added word wrap to the output class.</p>
				<div class=output>
					<h2>Script Output</h2>
					<script type="text/javascript" src="js/lab.js"></script>
				</div>
