			<h1>Lab 10 - JavaScript Events and Forms</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Challenge</h2>
				<p>The challenge was to use event listeners in Javascript to process and manipulate input and to
					manipulate the DOM to display these new values.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>I had trouble figuring out how to add a name to the input. My solution was that I had to put a label tag to initialize the name variable then assign that to the input name next.</p>
				<p>My first time testing tasks 2.1-2.3, index.html didn't display the results and thre the error: uName.split is not a function. My solution to this was adding type checking, but this wasn't the issue; I had accessed the entire element, and not its contents, so instead I accessed inputGet.value.</p>
				<p>I also got the error: failed to execute write on Document (async error) on remote page. The solution was that I had to reload the page, as the JS code hadn't loaded into GitHub yet.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I thought this lab was fun. I especially enjoyed task x, and by the variable names and atmosphere of the "cursed button", you can probably tell I tried to make an ominous-yet-goofy approach to having some being in the program glitching out the page because you pressed the forbidden button too many times. It was a bit of a chore getting the pizza pictures to display properly, but once I did, I had a blast randomizing all sorts of filter values for the images.</p>
